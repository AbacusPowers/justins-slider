#JSlider Introduction

This plugin takes a custom post type and loads it into a slider based on SlidesJS.

Currently, there is a function for each slider to be instantiated. In the future, this should be converted to a single function to build a slider, with an options page to build custom features for each instance.

This plugin can be installed and activated as a normal WP plugin, through the file uploader.
